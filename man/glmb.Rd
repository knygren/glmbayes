\arguments{
\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to be the number required.}

\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"\link[stats]{formula}"} (or one that
    can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
    model to be fitted.  The details of model specification are given
    under \sQuote{Details}.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. For \code{glmb} 
this can be a character string naming a family function, a family function or the result of a call to a family function. 
(See \code{\link{family}} for details of family functions.)}

\item{prior}{A list with the prior constants used by the model. Typically will include a prior
vector mu of length \code{p} giving the prior means of the variables in the
design matrix and a positive-definite symmetric matrix Sigma of dimension \code{p*p} 
specifying the prior covariance matrix of the variables. Optionally, prior constants 
shape and rate can also be provided for the dispersion parameters in the gaussian
and Gamma families (either together with or without the multivariate normal component). 
If no prior is provided for the dispersion, then the dispersion must be assumed to 
be a constant with the default for the Poisson and binomial families being a dispersion of 1.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame)
containing the variables in the model. If not found in \code{data}, the variables are taken from 
\code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which \code{glmb} is called.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of \sQuote{prior weights} to be used
    in the fitting process.  Should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector.}

\item{subset2}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an \code{a priori} known component to be included in the 
linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to the number 
of cases. One or more \code{\link{offset}} terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one 
is specified their sum is used. See \code{model.offset}.}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain \code{NA}s.  The default is set by 
the \code{na.action} setting of \code{\link{options}}, and is \code{\link[stats]{na.fail}} 
if that is unset.  The \sQuote{factory-fresh} default is \code{stats{na.omit}}.  
Another possible value is \code{NULL}, no action.  Value \code{stats{na.exclude}} 
can be useful.}

\item{Gridtype}{an optional argument specifying the method used to determine the number of tangent points used to construct the enveloping function.}

\item{start}{starting values for the parameters in the linear predictor.}

\item{etastart}{starting values for the linear predictor.}

\item{mustart}{starting values for the vector of means.}

\item{control}{a list of parameters for controlling the fitting
    process.  For \code{glm.fit} this is passed to
    \code{\link[stats]{glm.control}}.}

\item{model}{a logical value indicating whether \emph{model frame}
    should be included as a component of the returned value.}

\item{method}{the method to be used in fitting the classical model during a call to \code{\link{glm}}. The default method \code{glm.fit} 
uses iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS): the alternative \code{"model.frame"} returns the model frame and does no fitting.
User-supplied fitting functions can be supplied either as a function or a character string naming a 
function, with a function which takes the same arguments as \code{glm.fit}. If specified as a character string it is looked up from within the \pkg{stats} namespace.}

\item{x}{For \code{glm}:
    logical values indicating whether the response vector and model
    matrix used in the fitting process should be returned as components
    of the returned value.

    For \code{glm.fit}: \code{x} is a design matrix of dimension
    \code{n * p}, and \code{y} is a vector of observations of length
    \code{n}.
  }

\item{y}{For \code{glm}:
    logical values indicating whether the response vector and model
    matrix used in the fitting process should be returned as components
    of the returned value.

    For \code{glm.fit}: \code{x} is a design matrix of dimension
    \code{n * p}, and \code{y} is a vector of observations of length
    \code{n}.
  }

\item{contrasts}{an optional list. See the \code{contrasts.arg}
    of \code{model.matrix.default}.}

\item{...}{
    For \code{glm}: arguments to be used to form the default
    \code{control} argument if it is not supplied directly.

    For \code{weights}: further arguments passed to or from other methods.
  }

\item{digits}{the number of significant digits to use when printing.}
}
\value{
\code{glmb} returns an object of class \code{"glmb"}. The function \code{summary} (i.e., 
\code{\link{summary.glmb}}) can be used to obtain or print a summary of the results.  The generic accessor functions 
\code{\link{coefficients}}, \code{\link{fitted.values}}, \code{\link{residuals}}, and \code{\link{extractAIC}} can be used 
to extract various useful features of the value returned by code{\link{glmb}}.

An object of class \code{"glmb"} is a list containing at least the following components:
\item{glm}{an object of class \code{"glm"} containing the output from a call to the function \code{\link{glm}}}
\item{coefficients}{a matrix of dimension \code{n} by \code{length(mu)} with one sample in each row}
\item{coef.means}{a vector of \code{length(mu)} with the estimated posterior mean coefficients}
\item{coef.mode}{a vector of \code{length(mu)} with the estimated posterior mode coefficients}
\item{dispersion}{Either a constant provided as part of the call, or a vector of length \code{n} with one sample in each row.}
\item{Prior}{A list with the priors specified for the model in question. Items in
list may vary based on the type of prior}
\item{fitted.values}{a matrix of dimension \code{n} by \code{length(y)} with one sample for the mean fitted values in each row}
\item{family}{the \code{\link{family}} object used.}
\item{linear.predictors}{an \code{n} by \code{length(y)} matrix with one sample for the linear fit on the link scale in each row}
\item{deviance}{an \code{n} by \code{1} matrix with one sample for the deviance in each row}
\item{pD}{An Estimate for the effective number of parameters}
\item{Dbar}{Expected value for minus twice the log-likelihood function}
\item{Dthetabar}{Value of minus twice the log-likelihood function evaluated at the mean value for the coefficients}   
\item{DIC}{Estimated Deviance Information criterion} 
\item{prior.weights}{a vector of weights specified or implied by the model} 
\item{y}{a vector with the dependent variable} 
\item{x}{a matrix with the implied design matrix for the model} 
\item{model}{if requested (the default),the model frame} 
\item{call}{the matched call} 
\item{formula}{the formula supplie}

\item{contrasts}{(where relevant) the contrasts used.}
\item{xlevels}{(where relevant) a record of the levels of the factors used in fitting}
\item{digits}{the number of significant digits to use when printing.}
In addition, non-empty fits will have (yet to be implemented) components \code{qr}, \code{R}
and \code{effects} relating to the final weighted linear fit for the posterior mode.  
Objects of class \code{"glmb"} are normall of class \code{c("glmb","glm","lm")},
that is inherit from classes \code{glm} and \code{lm} and well-designed
methods from those classed will be applied when appropriate.

If a \link{binomial} \code{glmb} model was specified by giving a two-column 
response, the weights returned by \code{prior.weights} are the total number of
cases (factored by the supplied case weights) and the component of \code{y}
of the result is the proportion of successes.

\description{
\code{glmb} is used to fit Bayesian generalized linear models, specified by giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor, a description of the error distribution, and a multivariate normal prior.
}
\details{
The function \code{glmb} is a Bayesian version of the classical \code{\link{glm}} function.  Setup of
the models mirrors those for the \code{\link{glm}} function but add additional required arguments
\code{mu} and \code{Sigma}, representing a multivariate normal prior. In addition, the dispersion 
parameter must currently be provided for the gaussian, Gamma, quasipoisson, and quasibinomial families 
(future implementations may incoporate priors for these into the \code{glmb} function).  The function 
generates random iid samples from the posterior density associated with the model (assuming a fixed 
dispersion parameter). 

Current implemented models include the gaussian family (identity link function), the poisson and
quasipoisson families (log link function), the gamma family (log link function), as well as the 
binomial and quasibinomial families (logit, probit, and cloglog link functions).

The function returns the output from a call to the function \code{\link{glm}} as well as the simulated 
Bayesian coefficients and associated outputs. In addition, the function returns model diagnostic 
information related to the \code{DIC}, a Bayesian Information Criterion similar to the \code{AIC} for 
classical models. See \code{\link{glmbdic}} for details.  

For the gaussian family, iid samples from the posterior density are genererated using 
standard simulation procedures for multivariate normal densities. For all other 
families, the samples are generated using accept-reject procedures by leveraging the 
likelihood subgradient approach of Nygren and Nygren (2006). This approach relies on
tight enveloping functions that bound the posterior density from above. The Gridtype 
parameter is used to select the method used for determining the size of a Grid used 
to build the enveloping function. See \code{\link{EnvelopeBuild}} for details. 
Depending on the selection, the time to build the envelope and the acceptance rate 
during the simulation process may vary. The returned value \code{iters} contains the 
number of candidates generated before acceptance for each draw.
