\arguments{
\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to be the number required.}

\item{y}{a vector of observations of length \code{m}.}

\item{x}{a design matrix of dimension \code{m * p}.}

\item{b}{a vector of estimated regression parameters. Typically the output of a single draw using \code{\link{rglmb}} during block-Gibbs sampling.}

\item{alpha}{this can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known component to be included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of cases. One or more offset terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one is specified their sum is used. See \code{\link{model.offset}}.}

\item{wt}{an optional vector of \sQuote{prior weights} to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector.}

\item{shape}{Prior shape parameter for the dispersion parameter.}

\item{rate}{Prior rate parameter for the dispersion parameter.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. This can be a character string naming a family function, a family function or the result of a call to a family function. (See \code{\link{family}} for details of family functions.)}
}
\value{
\code{rglmb_dispersion} returns a object of class \code{"rglmbdisp"}.  The function \code{summary} 
(i.e., \code{\link{summary.rglmb}}) can be used to obtain or print a summary of the results.
The generic accessor functions \code{\link{coefficients}}, \code{\link{fitted.values}},
\code{\link{residuals}}, and \code{\link{extractAIC}} can be used to extract
various useful features of the value returned by \code{\link{rglmb_dispersion}}.
An object of class \code{"rglmbdisp"} is a list containing at least the following components:
\item{dispersion}{an \code{n} by \code{1} matrix with simulated values for the dispersion}
\item{Prior}{A list with two components. The first being the prior mean vector and the second the prior precision matrix}

\description{
\code{rglmb_dispersion} is used to generate iid samples for the dispersion parameter in Bayesian Generalized Linear models. 
The model is specified by providing the model structure, regression coefficient, and a Gamma prior.
}
\details{
The \code{rglmb} function produces iid samples for Bayesian generalized linear 
models. It has a more minimialistic interface than than the \code{\link{glmb}} 
function. Core required inputs for the function include the data vector, the design  
matrix and a prior specification. In addition, the dispersion parameter must 
currently be provided for the gaussian, Gamma, quasipoisson, and quasibinomial 
families (future implementations may incorporate a prior for these into the 
\code{rglmb} function).

Current implemented models include the gaussian family (identity link function), the
poisson and quasipoisson families (log link function), the gamma family (log link 
function), as well as the binomial and quasibinomial families (logit, probit, and 
cloglog link functions).  The function returns the simulated Bayesian coefficients 
and some associated outputs.

For the gaussian family, iid samples from the posterior density is genererated using 
standard simulation procedures for multivariate normal densities. For all other 
families, the samples are generated using accept-reject procedures by leveraging the 
likelihood subgradient approach of Nygren and Nygren (2006). This approach relies on
tight enveloping functions that bound the posterior density from above. The Gridtype 
parameter is used to select the method used for determining the size of a Grid used 
to build the enveloping function. See \code{\link{EnvelopeBuild_c}} for details. 
Depending on the selection, the time to build the envelope and the acceptance rate 
during the simulation process may vary. The returned value \code{iters} contains the 
number of candidates generated before acceptance for each draw.
