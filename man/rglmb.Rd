\arguments{
\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to be the number required.}

\item{y}{a vector of observations of length \code{m}.}

\item{x}{a design matrix of dimension \code{m * p}.}

\item{mu}{a vector of length \code{p} giving the prior means of the variables in the design matrix.}

\item{P}{a positive-definite symmetric matrix of dimension \code{p * p} specifying the prior precision matrix of the variable.}

\item{wt}{an optional vector of \sQuote{prior weights} to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector.}

\item{dispersion}{the dispersion parameter. Either a single numerical value or NULL (the default). Must be provided here, use \code{\link{rnorm_gamma_reg}} to give the dispersion a prior.}

\item{shape}{Prior shape parameter for the dispersion parameter (gaussian model only).}

\item{rate}{Prior rate parameter for the dispersion parameter (gaussian model only).}

\item{prior}{A list with the prior constants used by the model. Typically will include a prior
vector mu of length \code{p} giving the prior means of the variables in the
design matrix and a positive-definite symmetric matrix Sigma of dimension \code{p*p} 
specifying the prior covariance matrix of the variables. Optionally, prior constants 
shape and rate can also be provided for the dispersion parameters in the gaussian
and Gamma families (either together with or without the multivariate normal component). 
If no prior is provided for the dispersion, then the dispersion must be assumed to 
be a constant with the default for the Poisson and binomial families being a dispersion of 1.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. This can be a character string naming a family function, a family function or the result of a call to a family function. (See \code{\link{family}} for details of family functions.)}

\item{offset2}{this can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known component to be included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of cases. One or more offset terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one is specified their sum is used. See \code{\link{model.offset}}.}

\item{start}{an optional argument providing starting values for the posterior mode optimization.}

\item{Gridtype}{an optional argument specifying the method used to determine the number of tangent points used to construct the enveloping function.}

\item{digits}{the number of significant digits to use when printing.}

\item{\ldots}{additional optional arguments.}

\value{
\code{rglmb} returns a object of class \code{"rglmb"}.  The function \code{summary} 
(i.e., \code{\link{summary.rglmb}}) can be used to obtain or print a summary of the results.
The generic accessor functions \code{\link{coefficients}}, \code{\link{fitted.values}},
\code{\link{residuals}}, and \code{\link{extractAIC}} can be used to extract
various useful features of the value returned by \code{\link{rglmb}}.

\description{
\code{rglmb} is used to generate iid samples from Bayesian Generalized Linear Models 
with multivariate normal priors. The model is specified by providing a data vector, 
a design matrix, and 2 prior constants.
}
\details{
The \code{rglmb} function produces iid samples for Bayesian generalized linear 
models. It has a more minimialistic interface than than the \code{\link{glmb}} 
function. Core required inputs for the function include the data vector, the design  
matrix and a prior specification. In addition, the dispersion parameter must 
currently be provided for the gaussian, Gamma, quasipoisson, and quasibinomial 
families (future implementations may incorporate a prior for these into the 
\code{rglmb} function).

Current implemented models include the gaussian family (identity link function), the
poisson and quasipoisson families (log link function), the gamma family (log link 
function), as well as the binomial and quasibinomial families (logit, probit, and 
cloglog link functions). The function returns the simulated Bayesian coefficients 
and some associated outputs.

For the gaussian family, iid samples from the posterior density are genererated using 
standard simulation procedures for multivariate normal densities. For all other 
families, the samples are generated using accept-reject procedures by leveraging the 
likelihood subgradient approach of Nygren and Nygren (2006). This approach relies on
tight enveloping functions that bound the posterior density from above. The Gridtype 
parameter is used to select the method used for determining the size of a Grid used 
to build the enveloping function. See \code{\link{EnvelopeBuild}} for details. 
Depending on the selection, the time to build the envelope and the acceptance rate 
during the simulation process may vary. The returned value \code{iters} contains the 
number of candidates generated before acceptance for each draw.
