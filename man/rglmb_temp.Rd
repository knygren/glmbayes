\usage{
rglmb_temp(
  n = 1,
  y,
  x,
  family = gaussian(),
  pfamily,
  offset = NULL,
  weights = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to be the number required.}

\item{y}{For \code{glm}:
    logical values indicating whether the response vector and model
    matrix used in the fitting process should be returned as components
    of the returned value.

    For \code{glm.fit}: \code{x} is a design matrix of dimension
    \code{n * p}, and \code{y} is a vector of observations of length
    \code{n}.
  }

\item{x}{For \code{glm}:
    logical values indicating whether the response vector and model
    matrix used in the fitting process should be returned as components
    of the returned value.

    For \code{glm.fit}: \code{x} is a design matrix of dimension
    \code{n * p}, and \code{y} is a vector of observations of length
    \code{n}.
  }

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. For \code{glmb} 
this can be a character string naming a family function, a family function or the result of a call to a family function. 
(See \code{\link{family}} for details of family functions.)}

\item{pfamily}{the prior family to use for the model (including the constants passed to prior).}

\item{offset}{an offset parameter}

\item{weights}{a weighting variable}
}
\value{
Currently mainly the draws for the dispersion and the regression coefficients
will be updated to return outputs consistent with other function
}
\description{
\code{rglmb} is used to generate iid samples for Bayesian Generalized Linear Models.
The model is specified by providing a data vector, a design matrix, 
the family (determining the likelihood function) and the pfamily (determining the 
prior distribution).
