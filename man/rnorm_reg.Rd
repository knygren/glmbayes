\title{The Bayesian Normal Regression Distribution}
\usage{
rnorm_reg(n = 1, y, x, mu, P, wt = 1, dispersion = 1, offset2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to be the number required.}

\item{y}{a vector of observations of length \code{m}.}

\item{x}{a design matrix of dimension \code{m * p}.}

\item{mu}{a vector of length \code{p} giving the prior means of the variables in the design matrix.}

\item{P}{a positive-definite symmetric matrix of dimension \code{p * p} specifying the prior precision matrix of the variable.}

\item{wt}{an optional vector of \sQuote{prior weights} to be used in the fitting process. Should be NULL or a numeric vector.}

\item{dispersion}{the dispersion parameter. Either a single numerical value or NULL (the default). Must be provided here, use \code{\link{rnorm_gamma_reg}} to give the dispersion a prior.}

\item{offset2}{this can be used to specify an \emph{a priori} known component to be included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of cases. One or more offset terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one is specified their sum is used. See \code{\link{model.offset}}.}
}
\value{
The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}
}
\description{
\code{rnorm_reg} is used to generate iid samples from Bayesian linear models with a normal prior. 
The model is specified by providing a data vector, a design matrix, and 2 prior constants.
