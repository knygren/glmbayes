\arguments{
\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, the length is taken to be the number required.}

\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"\link[stats]{formula}"} (or one that
    can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
    model to be fitted.  The details of model specification are given
    under \sQuote{Details}.}

\item{mu}{a vector of length \code{p} giving the prior means of the variables in the design matrix.}

\item{Sigma}{a positive-definite symmetric matrix of dimension \code{p * p} specifying the prior covariance matrix of the variables.}

\item{dispersion}{the dispersion parameter. Either a single numerical value or NULL 
(the default). For families other than the Gamma and gaussian families, the dispersion
must be a constant.  where a prior can be given by using the shape and rate parameters (see \code{\link{rnorm_gamma_reg}}
for details}

\item{shape}{Optional prior shape parameter for the dispersion parameter (gaussian model only).}

\item{rate}{Optional prior rate parameter for the dispersion parameter (gaussian model only).}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object
    coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing
    the variables in the model.  If not found in \code{data}, the
    variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)},
    typically the environment from which \code{lm} is called.}

\item{subset2}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting
    process.  Should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector.
    If non-NULL, weighted least squares is used with weights
    \code{weights} (that is, minimizing \code{sum(w*e^2)}); otherwise
    ordinary least squares is used.  See also \sQuote{Details},}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain \code{NA}s.  The default is set by 
the \code{na.action} setting of \code{\link{options}}, and is \code{\link[stats]{na.fail}} 
if that is unset.  The \sQuote{factory-fresh} default is \code{stats{na.omit}}.  
Another possible value is \code{NULL}, no action.  Value \code{stats{na.exclude}} 
can be useful.}

\item{method}{the method to be used in fitting the classical model during a call to \code{\link{glm}}. The default method \code{glm.fit} 
uses iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS): the alternative \code{"model.frame"} returns the model frame and does no fitting.
User-supplied fitting functions can be supplied either as a function or a character string naming a 
function, with a function which takes the same arguments as \code{glm.fit}. If specified as a character string it is looked up from within the \pkg{stats} namespace.}

\item{model}{logicals.  If \code{TRUE} the corresponding
    components of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the
    response, the QR decomposition) are returned.
  }

\item{x}{logicals.  If \code{TRUE} the corresponding
    components of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the
    response, the QR decomposition) are returned.
  }

\item{y}{logicals.  If \code{TRUE} the corresponding
    components of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the
    response, the QR decomposition) are returned.
  }

\item{qr}{logicals.  If \code{TRUE} the corresponding
    components of the fit (the model frame, the model matrix, the
    response, the QR decomposition) are returned.
  }

\item{singular.ok}{logical. If \code{FALSE} (the default in S but
    not in \R) a singular fit is an error.}

\item{contrasts}{an optional list. See the \code{contrasts.arg} of 
\code{model.matrix.default}.}

\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an a priori known component to be 
included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric 
vector or matrix of extents
matching those of the response.  One or more \code{offset} terms can be
included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one are specified their 
sum is used.  See \code{model.offset}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the low level
    regression fitting functions (see below).}

\item{digits}{the number of significant digits to use when printing.}
}
\value{
\code{glmb} returns an object of class \code{"glmb"}. The function \code{summary} (i.e., 
\code{\link{summary.glmb}}) can be used to obtain or print a summary of the results.  The generic accessor functions 
\code{\link{coefficients}}, \code{\link{fitted.values}}, \code{\link{residuals}}, and \code{\link{extractAIC}} can be used 
to extract various useful features of the value returned by code{\link{glmb}}.

An object of class \code{"glmb"} is a list containing at least the following components:
\item{glm}{an object of class \code{"glm"} containing the output from a call to the function \code{\link{glm}}}
\item{coefficients}{a matrix of dimension \code{n} by \code{length(mu)} with one sample in each row}
\item{coef.means}{a vector of \code{length(mu)} with the estimated posterior mean coefficients}
\item{coef.mode}{a vector of \code{length(mu)} with the estimated posterior mode coefficients}
\item{dispersion}{Either a constant provided as part of the call, or a vector of length \code{n} with one sample in each row.}
\item{Prior}{A list with the priors specified for the model in question. Items in
list may vary based on the type of prior}
\item{fitted.values}{a matrix of dimension \code{n} by \code{length(y)} with one sample for the mean fitted values in each row}
\item{family}{the \code{\link{family}} object used.}
\item{linear.predictors}{an \code{n} by \code{length(y)} matrix with one sample for the linear fit on the link scale in each row}
\item{deviance}{an \code{n} by \code{1} matrix with one sample for the deviance in each row}
\item{pD}{An Estimate for the effective number of parameters}
\item{Dbar}{Expected value for minus twice the log-likelihood function}
\item{Dthetabar}{Value of minus twice the log-likelihood function evaluated at the mean value for the coefficients}   
\item{DIC}{Estimated Deviance Information criterion} 
\item{prior.weights}{a vector of weights specified or implied by the model} 
\item{y}{a vector with the dependent variable} 
\item{x}{a matrix with the implied design matrix for the model} 
\item{model}{if requested (the default),the model frame} 
\item{call}{the matched call}

\item{contrasts}{(where relevant) the contrasts used.}
\item{xlevels}{(where relevant) a record of the levels of the factors used in fitting}
\item{digits}{the number of significant digits to use when printing.}
In addition, non-empty fits will have (yet to be implemented) components \code{qr}, \code{R}
and \code{effects} relating to the final weighted linear fit for the posterior mode.  
Objects of class \code{"glmb"} are normall of class \code{c("glmb","glm","lm")},
that is inherit from classes \code{glm} and \code{lm} and well-designed
methods from those classed will be applied when appropriate.

If a \link{binomial} \code{glmb} model was specified by giving a two-column 
response, the weights returned by \code{prior.weights} are the total number of
cases (factored by the supplied case weights) and the component of \code{y}
of the result is the proportion of successes.

\description{
\code{glmb} is used to fit Bayesian generalized linear models, specified by giving a symbolic description of the linear predictor, a description of the error distribution, and a multivariate normal prior.
}
\details{
The function \code{glmb} is a Bayesian version of the classical \code{\link{glm}} function.  Setup of
the models mirrors those for the \code{\link{glm}} function but add additional required arguments
\code{mu} and \code{Sigma}, representing a multivariate normal prior. In addition, the dispersion 
parameter must currently be provided for the gaussian, Gamma, quasipoisson, and quasibinomial families 
(future implementations may incoporate priors for these into the \code{glmb} function).  The function 
generates random iid samples from the posterior density associated with the model (assuming a fixed 
dispersion parameter). 

Current implemented models include the gaussian family (identity link function), the poisson and
quasipoisson families (log link function), the gamma family (log link function), as well as the 
binomial and quasibinomial families (logit, probit, and cloglog link functions).

The function returns the output from a call to the function \code{\link{glm}} as well as the simulated 
Bayesian coefficients and associated outputs. In addition, the function returns model diagnostic 
information related to the \code{DIC}, a Bayesian Information Criterion similar to the \code{AIC} for 
classical models. See \code{\link{glmbdic}} for details.  

For the gaussian family, iid samples from the posterior density are genererated using 
standard simulation procedures for multivariate normal densities. For all other 
families, the samples are generated using accept-reject procedures by leveraging the 
likelihood subgradient approach of Nygren and Nygren (2006). This approach relies on
tight enveloping functions that bound the posterior density from above. The Gridtype 
parameter is used to select the method used for determining the size of a Grid used 
to build the enveloping function. See \code{\link{EnvelopeBuild}} for details. 
Depending on the selection, the time to build the envelope and the acceptance rate 
during the simulation process may vary. The returned value \code{iters} contains the 
number of candidates generated before acceptance for each draw.
