\title{The Central Normal Distribution}
\usage{
pnorm_ct(a = -Inf, b = Inf, mu = 0, sigma = 1, log.p = TRUE, Diff = FALSE)

rnorm_ct(n, lgrt, lglt, mu = 0, sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{lower bound}

\item{b}{upper bound}

\item{mu}{mean parameter}

\item{sigma}{standard deviation}

\item{log.p}{Logical argument. If \code{TRUE}, the log probability is provided}

\item{Diff}{Logical argument. If \code{TRUE} the second parameter is the difference between the lower and upper bound}

\item{n}{number of draws to generate. If \code{length(n) > 1}, 
the length is taken to be the number required}

\item{lgrt}{log of the distribution function between the 
lower bound and infinity}

\item{lglt}{log of the distribution function between negative 
infinity and the upper bound}
}
\value{
For \code{pnorm_ct}, vector of length equal to length of \code{a} and for
\code{rnorm_ct}, a vector with length determined by \code{n} containing draws from 
the center of the normal distribution.
}
\description{
Distribution function and random generation for the center (between a lower and an upper bound)
of the normal distribution with mean equal to mu and standard deviation equal to sigma.
}
\details{
The distribution function pnorm_ct finds the probability of the 
center of a normal density (the probability of the area between a lower 
bound a and an upper bound b) while the random number generator rnorm_ct 
samples from a restricted normal density where lgrt is the log of the 
distribution between the lower bound and infinity and lglt is the log of 
the distribution function between negative infinity and the upper bound. 
The sum of the exponentiated values for the two (exp(lgrt)+exp(lglt)) must 
sum to more than 1.

These functions are mainly used to handle cases where the differences 
between the upper and lower bounds \code{b-a} are small. In such cases,
using \code{pnorm(b)-pnorm(a)} may result in 0 being returned even when the 
difference is supposed to be positive.

pnorm_ct(0.2,0.4)
exp(pnorm_ct(0.2,0.4))
pnorm_ct(0.2,0.4,log.p=FALSE)
