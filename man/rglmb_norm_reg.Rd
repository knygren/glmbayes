\description{
\code{rglmb_norm_reg} is used to generate iid samples from Bayesian Generalized linear 
models with a normal prior. The model is specified by providing a data vector, a design matrix, 
and 2 prior constants (mu and Sigma) for the normal prior.
}
\details{
The \code{rglmb_norm_reg} function produces iid samples for Bayesian generalized linear 
models. with multivariate-normal priors. Core required inputs for the function include the data vector, 
the design matrix and a prior specification (provided in a list when this function is called directly). Specifying
the \code{\link{pfamily}} as \code{\link{dNormal}} in the \code{\link{lmb}} or \code{\link{glmb}} is equivalent
to calling this function directly.

The function returns the simulated Bayesian coefficients and some associated outputs. While it is possible to 
call this function directly, it is generally recommended that the \code{\link{lmb}}, \code{\link{rlmb}}, \code{\link{glmb}} or \code{\link{rglmb}} functions be used 
instead as those functions have more documentation and the resulting objects come with more methods.

When the specified family is gaussian, the multivariate normal is the conjugate prior distribution for the 
likelihood function and the posterior distribution is therefore also a multivariate normal density. Fairly
standard procedures are applied in order to generate samples in that case. Currently, this includes using a Cholesky 
decomposition. Later implementations may switch to a QR decomposition to increase consistency with the 
\code{\link{lm}} function and to increase associated numerical accuracy.

When the specified \code{\link{family}} is any log-concave non-gaussian family, then the estimation uses the Likelihood
subgradient density approach of Nygren and Nygren (2006).  This approaches uses tangencies to the 
log-likelihood function in order to construct an enveloping function from which candidate draws are 
generated and then either accepted/rejected using accept/reject methods. The core C function performing
this simulation essentially goes through the following steps: 
 

1) The model is standardized to have prior mean vector equal to 0 (i.e., offsets and any prior mean are combined
into a constant term).


2) The posterior mode for this transformed model is found. Currently this uses the \code{\link{optim}} function. 
Later implementations may replace this with iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS) to increase 
consistency with the \code{\link{glm}} function and to enhance numerical accuracy.


3) The model is further standardized so that (a) the precision matrix at the posterior mode is diagonal and (b)
the prior variance-covariance matrix is the identity matrix (see \code{\link{glmb_Standardize_Model}} for details).


4) An enveloping function is built for the the standardized model, containing constants needed during simulation (see
\code{\link{EnvelopeBuild}} for details).


5) Samples for the standardized model are generated using accept-reject methods (see \code{\link{rnnorm_reg_std}} for
details).


6) The output from the standardized model are transformed back to the original scale by reversing the two 
eigenvalue decompositions and by adding back the prior mean.
