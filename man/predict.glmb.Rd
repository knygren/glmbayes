\title{Predict Method for Bayesian GLM Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{glmb}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  type = "link",
  se.fit = FALSE,
  dispersion = NULL,
  terms = NULL,
  na.action = na.pass,
  olddata = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class inheriting from \code{"glmb"}.}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables
with which to predict. If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.}

\item{type}{the type of prediction required.  The default is on the scale of the linear predictors; 
the alternative \code{"response"} is on the scale of the response variable.  Thus for a default
binomial model the default predictions are of log-odds (probabilities
on logit scale) and \code{type = "response"} gives the predicted
probabilities.  The \code{"terms"} option returns a matrix giving the
fitted values of each term in the model formula on the linear predictor
scale (not implemented).}

\item{se.fit}{logical switch indicating if standard errors are required (not implemented).}

\item{dispersion}{the dispersion of the Bayesian GLM fit to be assumed in 
computing the standard errors. If omitted, that returned by the \code{summary} applied 
to the object is used.}

\item{terms}{with \code{type="terms"} by default all terms are returned.
A character vector specifies which terms are to be returned.}

\item{na.action}{function determining what should be done with missing values in
\code{newdata}. The default is to predict \code{NA}.}

\item{olddata}{a data frame that should contain all the variables used in the 
original model specification. Must currently be provided whenever newdata is 
provided and rbind(olddata,newdata) must not lead to an error being returned.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A list with the Estimated effective number of parameters \code{pD}
and the \code{DIC} from the object \code{fit} of class \code{"glmb"}. See \code{\link{glmbdic}}
for details on the definition of these objects.
}
\description{
Obtains predictions and optionally estimates standard errors of those
predictions from a fitted Bayesian generalized linear model object.
}
\details{
If \code{newdata} is omitted the predictions are based on the data
used for the fit.  In that case how cases with missing values in the
original fit is determined by the \code{na.action} argument of that
fit.  If \code{na.action = na.omit} omitted cases will not appear in 
the residuals, whereas if \code{na.action = na.exclude} they will 
appear (in predictions and standard errors), with residual value
\code{NA}.  See also \code{\link{napredict}}.
}
\note{
Variables are first looked for in \code{newdata} and then searched for
in the usual way (which will include the environment of the formula 
used in the fit).  A warning will be given if the 
variables found are not of the same length as those in \code{newdata}
if it was supplied.
