\title{Predict Method for Bayesian GLM Fits}
\usage{
\method{predict}{glmb}(
  object,
  newdata = NULL,
  type = "link",
  se.fit = FALSE,
  dispersion = NULL,
  terms = NULL,
  na.action = na.pass,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class inheriting from \code{"glmb"}.}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables
with which to predict. If omitted, the fitted linear predictors are used.}

\item{type}{the type of prediction required.  The default is on the scale of the linear predictors; 
the alternative \code{"response"} is on the scale of the response variable.  Thus for a default
binomial model the default predictions are of log-odds (probabilities
on logit scale) and \code{type = "response"} gives the predicted
probabilities.  The \code{"terms"} option returns a matrix giving the
fitted values of each term in the model formula on the linear predictor
scale (not implemented).}

\item{se.fit}{logical switch indicating if standard errors are required (not implemented).}

\item{dispersion}{the dispersion of the Bayesian GLM fit to be assumed in 
computing the standard errors. If omitted, that returned by the \code{summary} applied 
to the object is used.}

\item{terms}{with \code{type="terms"} by default all terms are returned.
A character vector specifies which terms are to be returned.}

\item{na.action}{function determining what should be done with missing values in
\code{newdata}. The default is to predict \code{NA}.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A list with the Estimated effective number of parameters \code{pD}
and the \code{DIC} from the object \code{fit} of class \code{"glmb"}. See \code{\link{glmbdic}}
for details on the definition of these objects.
}
\description{
Obtains predictions and optionally estimates standard errors of those
predictions from a fitted Bayesian generalized linear model object.
}
\details{
If \code{newdata} is omitted the predictions are based on the data
used for the fit.  In that case how cases with missing values in the
original fit is determined by the \code{na.action} argument of that
fit.  If \code{na.action = na.omit} omitted cases will not appear in 
the residuals, whereas if \code{na.action = na.exclude} they will 
appear (in predictions and standard errors), with residual value
\code{NA}.  See also \code{\link{napredict}}.
}
\note{
Variables are first looked for in \code{newdata} and then searched for
in the usual way (which will include the environment of the formula 
used in the fit).  A warning will be given if the 
variables found are not of the same length as those in \code{newdata}
if it was supplied.
